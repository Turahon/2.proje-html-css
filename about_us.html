    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <h3>In 1977, we opened our doors as a small restaurant in the city center.<br> Our founder, Master Chef Ivan Kuzmin, dreamed of a place where people could come together not only for food,<br> but also for peace and a warm atmosphere.<br>
    At that time, our menu had only a few home-cooked dishes — but every plate had labor, love and sincerity.<br> That's why we quickly became the most popular place in our neighborhood.<br>
    Over time, generations have changed, but we have preserved our tradition.<br> Today we are still serving with the same spirit, with the same recipes, just with a little more experience.<br>
    Our January has been offering the same taste and the same temperature for half a century.</h3>
